INFO
====

haskdogs is a small shellscript-like tool which creates tag file for entire
haskell project directory. It takes into account first-level dependencies by
recursively scanning imports and adding matching packages to the final
tag list.

As a result, programmer can use his/her text editor supporting tags (vim, for
example) to jump directly to definition of any standard or foreign function
he/she uses.

Note, that haskdogs calls some Unix shell commands like 'test' or 'mkdir' via
SHS so this tool will probably work on Linuxes and maybe Macs. Pure Windows
will fail to run it.

1. git clone https://github.com/ierton/haskdogs
